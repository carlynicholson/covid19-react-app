# Project Evaluation

We use the following rubric for our evaluation, but ultimately it is up to your
instructors as to whether your project is complete.

## Hard Requirements

The following **_must_** be met in order for the project to be considered
complete:

&#9745; The app is deployed fully deployed (both the front-end and the back-end).  
&#9745; New repos with the students' project code are included in the submission.  
&#9745; Students include a `planning/` directory that sufficiently demonstrates their
  team's planning process.  
  &#9745; The repos have a README that adequately documents the project.  
  &#9745; The commit history of your repos show a roughly equal number of commits from
  each group member

## Criteria

We will evaluate your project according to the following criteria:

- **Code Quality:** Is the code well formatted? Is the code easy to read and
  understand? Does the code follow best practices?  
    
  *Self-Evaluation Score: 2*  
  The application's code is broken into easy-to-navigate components and placed in their clearly labeled, respective folders. Code is free of comments and console logs.  

- **Technical Requirements:** How does the project stack up to the requirements
  for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in
  a way that makes sense?  
    
  *Self-Evaluation Score: 2*  
  The project meets the technical requirements as stated in the [project outline](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIR-224/seir-224-project-2/blob/master/readme.md).  

- **Creativity & Interface:** Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work
  well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI
  Themes?  
    
  *Self-Evaluation Score: 2*  

- **Functionality:** Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it
  present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that
  makes sense?  
    
  *Self-Evaluation Score: 2*  

- **Presentation:** Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well
  organized and free of clutter?  
    
  *Self-Evaluation Score: 3*  


## Scoring

Each of the above categories will be scored according to the following:

| Score | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | Incomplete  |
| 1     | Progressing |
| 2     | Performing  |
| 3     | Excelling   |

For a project to be considered complete, you must achieve at least "Progressing"
in each category. However, at a minimum, you should aim to achieve "Performing"
in every category.
